The "GuessNumber" program is a Java application that simulates a two-player guessing game. In each turn, a player inputs a number between 1 and 10, and the program generates a random number for comparison. If the player's guess matches the generated number, their score increases, and the program displays the details of the guess, including the random number and the current score. The game continues indefinitely in a loop, with both players taking turns. The first player to reach a score of 10 is declared the winner, and the program exits, announcing the victorious player.
If there are any mistakes made, let me know. Have Fun!
